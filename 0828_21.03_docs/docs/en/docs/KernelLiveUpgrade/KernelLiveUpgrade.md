# Kernel Hot Upgrade GuideThis document describes how to install, deploy, and use the kernel hot upgrade feature on openEuler. This kernel hot upgrade feature on openEuler is implemented through quick kernel restart and hot program migration. A user-mode tool is provided to automate this process.This document is intended for community developers, open-source enthusiasts, and partners who want to learn about and use the openEuler system and kernel hot upgrade. The users are expected to know basics about the Linux operating system.## Application ScenarioThe kernel hot upgrade is to save and restore the process running data with the second-level end-to-end latency.The following two conditions must be met:1. The kernel needs to be restarted due to vulnerability fixing or version update.2. Services running on the kernel can be quickly recovered after the kernel is restarted.
