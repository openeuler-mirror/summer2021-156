|:---  |:----  |
| [I1VR1W](https://gitee.com/open_euler/dashboard/issues?id=I1VR1W) | An error message is displayed when the x86 QCOW2 image is used for VM creation or the ISO image is used for physical machine installation. The error message is output as expected. For details, see the issue response. |
| [I1U1LP](https://gitee.com/open_euler/dashboard/issues?id=I1U1LP) | arm The ARM-based physical machine uses the drive that has been written into the file system for customized partitioning, but the partitioning fails. A special path can be used to prevent this issue. For details, see the issue response. |
| [I1VTC5](https://gitee.com/open_euler/dashboard/issues?id=I1VTC5) | In the pressure test in the overcommitment scenario, frame freezing occurs to vmtop -H page turning when the number of vCPUs is greater than 1,000. The impact scope is controllable. For details, see the issue response. |
| [I1WVM8](https://gitee.com/open_euler/dashboard/issues?id=I1WVM8) | Among the CPU usage data collected by vmtop, the single core whose usage exceeds 100% exists. The impact scope is controllable. For details, see the issue response. |
