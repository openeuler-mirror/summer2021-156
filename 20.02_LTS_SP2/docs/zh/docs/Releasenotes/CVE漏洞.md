|CVE-2020-35452    | httpd                   | Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.46 A specially crafted Digest nonce can cause a stack overflow in mod_auth_digest. There is no report of this overflow being exploitable, nor the Apache HTTP Server team could create one, though some particular compiler and/or compilation option might make it possible, with limited consequences anyway due to the size (a single byte) and the value (zero byte) of the overflow                                                                                 | 7.3         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2020-13950    | httpd                   | Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.41 to 2.4.46 mod_proxy_http can be made to crash (NULL pointer dereference) with specially crafted requests using both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers, leading to a Denial of Service                                                                                                                                                                                      | 7.5         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2021-33560    | libgcrypt                   |   Libgcrypt before 1.8.8 and 1.9.x before 1.9.3 mishandles ElGamal encryption because it lacks exponent blinding to address a side-channel attack against mpi_powm, and the window size is not chosen appropriately. (There is also an interoperability problem because the selection of the k integer value does not properly consider the differences between basic ElGamal encryption and generalized ElGamal encryption.) This, for example, affects use of ElGamal in OpenPGP.                                                                                                                 | 7.5         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2021-3549    | binutils                   |   An out of bounds flaw was found in GNU binutils objdump utility version 2.36. An attacker could use this flaw and pass a large section to avr_elf32_load_records_from_section() probably resulting in a crash or in some cases memory corruption. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity as well as system availability.                                                                                                                 | 7.1         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2021-3560    | polkit                   |   A flaw was found in polkit. When a requesting process disconnects from dbus-daemon just before the call to polkit_system_bus_name_get_creds_sync starts, the process cannot get a unique uid and pid of the process and it cannot verify the privileges of the requesting process. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.                                                                                                                 | 7.8         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2020-27748    | xdg-utils                   |   A flaw was found in the xdg-email component of xdg-utils-1.1.0-rc1 and newer. When handling mailto: URIs, xdg-email allows attachments to be discreetly added via the URI when being passed to Thunderbird. An attacker could potentially send a victim a URI that automatically attaches a sensitive file to a new email. If a victim user does not notice that an attachment was added and sends the email, this could result in sensitive information disclosure. It has been confirmed that the code behind this issue is in xdg-email and not in Thunderbird.                                                                                                                 | 6.5         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2021-26691    | httpd                   |   In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.46 a specially crafted SessionHeader sent by an origin server could cause a heap overflow                                                                                                                 | 5.9         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2021-23017    | nginx                   |   A security issue in nginx resolver was identified, which might allow an attacker who is able to forge UDP packets from the DNS server to cause 1-byte memory overwrite, resulting in worker process crash or potential other impact.                                                                                                                 | 9.8         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2021-31535    | libX11                   |   LookupCol.c in X.Org X through X11R7.7 and libX11 before 1.7.1 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. The libX11 XLookupColor request (intended for server-side color lookup) contains a flaw allowing a client to send color-name requests with a name longer than the maximum size allowed by the protocol (and also longer than the maximum packet size for normal-sized packets). The user-controlled data exceeding the maximum size is then interpreted by the server as additional X protocol requests and executed, e.g., to disable X server authorization completely. For example, if the victim encounters malicious terminal control sequences for color codes, then the attacker may be able to take full control of the running graphical session.                                                                                                                 | 9.8         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2021-3468    | avahi                   |   A flaw was found in avahi in versions 0.6 up to 0.8. The event used to signal the termination of the client connection on the avahi Unix socket is not correctly handled in the client_work function, allowing a local attacker to trigger an infinite loop. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to the availability of the avahi service, which becomes unresponsive after this flaw is triggered.                                                                                                                 | 5.5         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2020-6950    | mojarra                   |   Directory traversal in Eclipse Mojarra before 2.3.14 allows attackers to read arbitrary files via the loc parameter or con parameter.                                                                                                                 | 7.5         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2021-33620    | squid                   |   Squid before 4.15 and 5.x before 5.0.6 allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (affecting availability to all clients) via an HTTP response. The issue trigger is a header that can be expected to exist in HTTP traffic without any malicious intent by the server.                                                                                                                 | 6.5         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2020-10688    | resteasy                   |   A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in RESTEasy in versions before 3.11.1.Final and before 4.5.3.Final, where it did not properly handle URL encoding when the RESTEASY003870 exception occurs. An attacker could use this flaw to launch a reflected XSS attack.                                                                                                                 | 6.1         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2020-26945    | mybatis                   |   MyBatis before 3.5.6 mishandles deserialization of object streams.                                                                                                                 | 8.1         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2021-25217    | dhcp                   |   In ISC DHCP 4.1-ESV-R1 -> 4.1-ESV-R16, ISC DHCP 4.4.0 -> 4.4.2 (Other branches of ISC DHCP (i.e., releases in the 4.0.x series or lower and releases in the 4.3.x series) are beyond their End-of-Life (EOL) and no longer supported by ISC. From inspection it is clear that the defect is also present in releases from those series, but they have not been officially tested for the vulnerability), The outcome of encountering the defect while reading a lease that will trigger it varies, according to: the component being affected (i.e., dhclient or dhcpd) whether the package was built as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary whether the compiler flag -fstack-protection-strong was used when compiling In dhclient, ISC has not successfully reproduced the error on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bit system it is possible to cause dhclient to crash when reading an improper lease, which could cause network connectivity problems for an affected system due to the absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, when run in DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 32-bit architecture AND the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified to the compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing a lease file containing an objectionable lease, resulting in lack of service to clients. Additionally, the offending lease and the lease immediately following it in the lease database may be improperly deleted. if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 64-bit architecture OR if the -fstack-protection-strong compiler flag was NOT specified, the crash will not occur, but it is possible for the offending lease and the lease which immediately followed it to be improperly deleted.                                                                                                                 | 7.4         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2021-29478    | redis                   |   Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. An integer overflow bug in Redis 6.2 before 6.2.3 could be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. Redis 6.0 and earlier are not directly affected by this issue. The problem is fixed in version 6.2.3. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the `set-max-intset-entries` configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the `CONFIG SET` command.                                                                                                                 | 8.8         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2016-3982    | optipng                   |   Off-by-one error in the bmp_rle4_fread function in pngxrbmp.c in OptiPNG before 0.7.6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read or write access and crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted image file, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.                                                                                                                 | 8.8         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2016-3981    | optipng                   |   Heap-based buffer overflow in the bmp_read_rows function in pngxrbmp.c in OptiPNG before 0.7.6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read or write access and crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted image file.                                                                                                                 | 7.8         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2016-9296    | p7zip                   |   A null pointer dereference bug affects the 16.02 and many old versions of p7zip. A lack of null pointer check for the variable folders.PackPositions in function CInArchive::ReadAndDecodePackedStreams in CPP/7zip/Archive/7z/7zIn.cpp, as used in the 7z.so library and in 7z applications, will cause a crash and a denial of service when decoding malformed 7z files.                                                                                                                 | 7.5         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2018-10115    | p7zip                   |   Incorrect initialization logic of RAR decoder objects in 7-Zip 18.03 and before can lead to usage of uninitialized memory, allowing remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) or execute arbitrary code via a crafted RAR archive.                                                                                                                 | 7.8         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2018-5996    | p7zip                   |   Insufficient exception handling in the method NCompress::NRar3::CDecoder::Code of 7-Zip before 18.00 and p7zip can lead to multiple memory corruptions within the PPMd code, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) or execute arbitrary code via a crafted RAR archive.                                                                                                                 | 7.8         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2017-17969    | p7zip                   |   Heap-based buffer overflow in the NCompress::NShrink::CDecoder::CodeReal method in 7-Zip before 18.00 and p7zip allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) or potentially execute arbitrary code via a crafted ZIP archive.                                                                                                                 | 7.8         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2021-22898    | curl                   | curl 7.7 through 7.76.1 suffers from an information disclosure when the `-t` command line option, known as `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS` in libcurl, is used to send variable=content pairs to TELNET servers. Due to a flaw in the option parser for sending NEW_ENV variables, libcurl could be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based buffer to the server, resulting in potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using a clear-text network protocol.                                                                                                                 | 5.9         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2021-22897    | curl                   | curl 7.61.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from exposure of data element to wrong session due to a mistake in the code for CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST when libcurl is built to use the Schannel TLS library. The selected cipher set was stored in a single "static" variable in the library, which has the surprising side-effect that if an application sets up multiple concurrent transfers, the last one that sets the ciphers will accidentally control the set used by all transfers. In a worst-case scenario, this weakens transport security significantly.                                                                                                                 | 3.7         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2021-25317    | cups                   |   A Incorrect Default Permissions vulnerability in the packaging of cups of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11-SP4-LTSS, SUSE Manager Server 4.0, SUSE OpenStack Cloud Crowbar 9; openSUSE Leap 15.2, Factory allows local attackers with control of the lp users to create files as root with 0644 permissions without the ability to set the content. This issue affects: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11-SP4-LTSS cups versions prior to 1.3.9. SUSE Manager Server 4.0 cups versions prior to 2.2.7. SUSE OpenStack Cloud Crowbar 9 cups versions prior to 1.7.5. openSUSE Leap 15.2 cups versions prior to 2.2.7. openSUSE Factory cups version 2.3.3op2-2.1 and prior versions.                                                                                                                 | 3.3         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2020-8112    | openjpeg2                   |   opj_t1_clbl_decode_processor in openjp2/t1.c in OpenJPEG 2.3.1 through 2020-01-28 has a heap-based buffer overflow in the qmfbid==1 case, a different issue than CVE-2020-6851.                                                                                                                 | 8.8         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2020-6851    | openjpeg2                   |   AOpenJPEG through 2.3.1 has a heap-based buffer overflow in opj_t1_clbl_decode_processor in openjp2/t1.c because of lack of opj_j2k_update_image_dimensions validation.                                                                                                                 | 7.5         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2020-27824    | openjpeg2                   |   A flaw was found in OpenJPEG’s encoder in the opj_dwt_calc_explicit_stepsizes() function. This flaw allows an attacker who can supply crafted input to decomposition levels to cause a buffer overflow. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.                                                                                                                 | 5.5         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2020-27823    | openjpeg2                   |   A flaw was found in OpenJPEG’s encoder. This flaw allows an attacker to pass specially crafted x,y offset input to OpenJPEG to use during encoding. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.                                                                                                                 | 7.8         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2021-3472    | xorg-x11-server                   |   A flaw was found in xorg-x11-server in versions before 1.20.11. An integer underflow can occur in xserver which can lead to a local privilege escalation. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.                                                                                                                 | 7.8         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2020-27756    | ImageMagick                   |   In ParseMetaGeometry() of MagickCore/geometry.c, image height and width calculations can lead to divide-by-zero conditions which also lead to undefined behavior. This flaw can be triggered by a crafted input file processed by ImageMagick and could impact application availability. The patch uses multiplication in addition to the function `PerceptibleReciprocal()` in order to prevent such divide-by-zero conditions. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.                                                                                                                 | 5.5         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2020-25667    | ImageMagick                   |   TIFFGetProfiles() in /coders/tiff.c calls strstr() which causes a large out-of-bounds read when it searches for ` dc:format=  image/dng  ` within `profile` due to improper string handling, when a crafted input file is provided to ImageMagick. The patch uses a StringInfo type instead of a raw C string to remedy this. This could cause an impact to availability of the application. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.                                                                                                                 | 5.5         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2020-27753    | ImageMagick                   |   There are several memory leaks in the MIFF coder in /coders/miff.c due to improper image depth values, which can be triggered by a specially crafted input file. These leaks could potentially lead to an impact to application availability or cause a denial of service. It was originally reported that the issues were in `AcquireMagickMemory()` because that is where LeakSanitizer detected the leaks, but the patch resolves issues in the MIFF coder, which incorrectly handles data being passed to `AcquireMagickMemory()`. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.                                                                                                                 | 5.5         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2021-20201    | spice                   |   A flaw was found in spice in versions before 0.14.92. A DoS tool might make it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by performing many renegotiations within a single connection.                                                                                                                 | 5.3         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2021-3445    | libdnf                   |   A flaw was found in libdnf s signature verification functionality in versions before 0.60.1. This flaw allows an attacker to achieve code execution if they can alter the header information of an RPM package and then trick a user or system into installing it. The highest risk of this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.                                                                                                                 | 8.8         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2020-25710    | openldap                   |   A flaw was found in OpenLDAP in versions before 2.4.56. This flaw allows an attacker who sends a malicious packet processed by OpenLDAP to force a failed assertion in csnNormalize23(). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.                                                                                                                 | 7.5         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2021-33574    | glibc                   |   The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc) versions 2.32 and 2.33 has a use-after-free. It may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller, leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly unspecified other impact.                                                                                                                 | 9.8         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2021-3541    | libxml2                   |   This library allows to manipulate XML files. It includes supportto read, modify and write XML and HTML files. There is DTDs supportthis includes parsing and validation even with complex DtDs, eitherat parse time or later once the document has been modified.

| CVE-2021-21702    | php                   |   In PHP versions 7.3.x below 7.3.27, 7.4.x below 7.4.15 and 8.0.x below 8.0.2, when using SOAP extension to connect to a SOAP server, a malicious SOAP server could return malformed XML data as a response that would cause PHP to access a null pointer and thus cause a crash.                                                                                                                 | 7.5         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2021-29509    | rubygem-puma                   |   Puma is a concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests False` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.                                                                                                                 | 7.5         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2021-3517    | libxml2                   |   There is a flaw in the xml entity encoding functionality of libxml2 in versions before 2.9.11. An attacker who is able to supply a crafted file to be processed by an application linked with the affected functionality of libxml2 could trigger an out-of-bounds read. The most likely impact of this flaw is to application availability, with some potential impact to confidentiality and integrity if an attacker is able to use memory information to further exploit the application.                                                                                                                 | 8.6         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2021-3518    | libxml2                   |   There s a flaw in libxml2 in versions before 2.9.11. An attacker who is able to submit a crafted file to be processed by an application linked with libxml2 could trigger a use-after-free. The greatest impact from this flaw is to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.                                                                                                                 | 8.8         | 已修复  |
| CVE-2021-32617    | exiv2                   |   Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An inefficient algorithm (quadratic complexity) was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. The inefficient algorithm is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4. Note that this bug is only triggered when _writing_ the metadata, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation than _reading_ the metadata. For example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an extra command-line argument such as `rm`.                                                                                                                 | 5.5         | 已修复  |

| CVE-2021-29428    | gradle                   |   In Gradle before version 7.0, on Unix-like systems, the system temporary directory can be created with open permissions that allow multiple users to create and delete files within it. Gradle builds could be vulnerable to a local privilege escalation from an attacker quickly deleting and recreating files in the system temporary directory. This vulnerability impacted builds using precompiled script plugins written in Kotlin DSL and tests for Gradle plugins written using ProjectBuilder or TestKit. If you are on Windows or modern versions of macOS, you are not vulnerable. If you are on a Unix-like operating system with the  sticky  bit set on your system temporary directory, you are not vulnerable. The problem has been patched and released with Gradle 7.0. As a workaround, on Unix-like operating systems, ensure that the  sticky  bit is set. This only allows the original user (or root) to delete a file. If you are unable to change the permissions of the system temporary directory, you can move the Java temporary directory by setting the System Property `java.io.tmpdir`. The new path needs to limit permissions to the build user only.
